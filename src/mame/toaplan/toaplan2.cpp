    SET NOTES:

    ghox     - The ghoxj set displays an English title screen when the jumpers are set for Japan/Taito,
               and fails to display the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" logo when set for USA/Taito (either
               Taito America or Taito Japan).

    dogyuun  - In the location test version, if you are hit while you have a bomb, the bomb explodes
               automatically and saves you from dying. In the final released version, the bomb explodes
               but you die anyway.
               The only difference between the dogyuun and dogyuuna sets is some of the region jumper
               settings; see the INPUT_PORTS definitions.

    truxton2 - Although the truxton2 PCB has only standard JAMMA mono audio output, and uses a YM3014B
               mono DAC, the YM2151 music is actually sequenced in stereo. In toaplan2.h, uncomment
               "#define TRUXTON2_STEREO" to hear the game's music the way it was originally composed.
               Difficulty is much lower when the region is set to Europe or USA than when set to any
               Asian region, independent of the "Difficulty" dipswitches. See the code beginning at
               1FE94 (RAM address 1002D6 contains 0 if region is an Asian region, 1 if Europe or USA)

    fixeight - The same program is used for all regions, and the region can be changed just by swapping
               EEPROMs. However, the V25 code also recognizes a secret input that rewrites the EEPROM to
               use any one of the 14 recognized regional licenses, using the state of the player 1 and
               player 2 button inputs held in conjunction with it as a 4-bit binary code:

               Region                      Button input

               Japan, Taito license        P1 buttons 1 & 2 + P2 buttons 1 & 2

    grindstm - Code at 20A26 in vfive forces region to Japan. All sets have some NOPs at reset vector,
               and the NEC V25 CPU test that the other games do is skipped. Furthermore, all sets have
               a broken ROM checksum routine that reads address ranges that don't match the actual
               location or size of the ROM, and that has a hack at the end so it always passes.
               Normally you would expect to see code like this in a bootleg, but the NOPs and other
               oddities are identical among three different sets.

    batsugun - The Special Version has many changes to make the game easier: it adds an autofire button,
               replaces the regular bomb with the more powerful double bomb (which in the original version
               required both players in a two player game to press their bomb buttons at once), gives you
               a shield that can absorb one hit each time your ship "levels up", etc. It also changes the
               colors of the title screen, ship select screen, stages, and enemies.
               batsugun compared to batsuguna has code that looks more like the Special Version, but it
               doesn't have any of the Special Version features. All the differences between batsugun
               and batsuguna look like bug fixes that were carried over into the Special Version.

    sstriker - The mahoudai set reads the region jumpers, but the lookup tables in ROM that map jumper
               settings to copyright text, coinage settings, etc., contain identical values for every
               jumper setting, effectively ignoring the jumpers and forcing the region to Japan.
               On the other hand, sstriker has its title screen and all its text in English even when
               the region is set to Japan. This seems odd but has been verified correct on two boards.
               The only difference between sstriker and sstrikera is the copyright text displayed when
               the region is set to Korea.

    kingdmgp - The kingdmgp and shippumd sets have identical program ROMs but a different graphics ROM
               for the text layer. Setting the region to Japan with the kingdmgp ROM, or to anything other
               than Japan with the shippumd ROM, results in a corrupt title screen and unreadable text.
               In kingdmgp some of the tiles needed for the credits screen in attract mode have been
               stripped out, resulting in boxes where letters should be. It doesn't seem very professional
               but appears to be a genuine release. A lot of boards being sold as 'Kingdom Grand Prix' are
               in fact conversions using Neill Corlett's hack.

    bgaregga - The later versions change the small bullet-shaped enemy bullets to bright yellow balls,
               eliminate the flying metal debris from explosions, and require additional joystick input
               to access the Extended, Harder, Special, and Stage Edit hidden features.
               In addition to these changes, the bgareggat2 set uses only two buttons. Instead of being
               able to change the formation of your options with the third button, each of the selectable
               ships has a different, fixed option formation. However, the third button can still be used
               to select an alternate ship color and to enter the secret character and Stage Edit codes.

    batrider - Batrider was marketed as a two button game, and the regular ships all use only the first
               two buttons, but in the original version you need the third button in order to control the
               options of the hidden Battle Garegga ships.
               This problem was fixed in the B Version, which lets you change the Battle Garegga ships'
               option formation using Street Fighter style joystick commands (as well as by using the third
               button, if the cabinet has one)

    bbakraid - Because players managed to counter stop the original Battle Bakraid not long after release,
               the Unlimited Version, which can display more score digits, was released as a ROM upgrade.
               The upgrade also fixes the bug in the original version that prevented the unlocking of
               Team Edit mode from being saved in the EEPROM.

  Batsugun has the CPU hooked up in non-encrypted mode.

Notes:
    See Input Port definition header below, for instructions
      on how to enter pause/slow motion modes.

To Do / Unknowns:
    - Whoopee/Teki Paki sometimes tests bit 5 of the region jumper port
        just after testing for vblank. Why?
    - Priority problem on 2nd player side of selection screen in Fixeight bootleg.
    - Fixeight bootleg text in sound check mode does not display properly
        with the CPU set to 10MHz (ok at 16MHz). Possible error in video_count_r routine.
    - Need to sort out the video status register.
    - Find out how exactly how sound CPU communication really works in bgaregga/batrider/bbakraid
        current emulation seems to work (plays all sounds), but there are still some unknown reads/writes
    - Music timing is bit different on bbakraid.
        reference : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjrWs0iHQ5A

Notes on Power Kick coin inputs:
- The 10 yen input is "Key In" according to the bookkeeping screen, but is
  an otherwise normal coin input with a counter and a lockout (sharing the
  latter with the "medal" coin).
- The 100 yen input never adds any credits except in "Coin Function Check,"
  instead dispensing its value into the hopper immediately.

To reset the NVRAM in Othello Derby, hold P1 Button 1 down while booting.
